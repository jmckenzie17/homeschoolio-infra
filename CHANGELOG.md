## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `modules/azure-aks` v1.0.0 — Public AKS cluster with `authorized_ip_ranges` restricting API
  server access; pre-allocated static outbound public IP for deterministic PostgreSQL firewall rules;
  kubenet network plugin; Workload Identity enabled with ESO user-assigned managed identity and
  federated identity credential
- `modules/azure-postgresql` v1.0.0 — PostgreSQL Flexible Server with public endpoint restricted to
  AKS outbound IP via firewall rule; pre-seeded with `temporal` and `temporal_visibility` databases;
  max_connections and pg_stat_statements tuned for Temporal workloads
- `modules/azure-key-vault` v1.0.0 — Key Vault in RBAC mode with public endpoint and no
  network-level firewall; PostgreSQL credentials stored as secrets; ESO UAMI granted Key Vault
  Secrets User role
- Terragrunt roots for `dev`, `staging`, and `production` environments for `aks`, `postgresql`,
  and `key-vault` modules
- Extended `policies/naming.rego` enforced_types with `azurerm_postgresql_flexible_server`,
  `azurerm_user_assigned_identity`, `azurerm_public_ip`
- `modules/azure-resource-group` v1.0.0 — OpenTofu module that provisions a tagged Azure resource
  group (`{project}-{environment}-rg-main`) with required `Project`, `Environment`, `ManagedBy`,
  and `Owner` tags; satisfies OPA naming and tag policies
- Terragrunt roots for `dev`, `staging`, and `production` environments under
  `environments/{env}/resource-group/`
- `policies/README.md` — documents `tags.rego` and `naming.rego`: what each enforces, example
  violations, passing examples, and local Conftest invocation

### Changed

- `ci.yml` — narrowed `plan` job `environments` input from `"dev,staging,production"` to `"dev"`;
  aligns with dev-only CD scope (spec clarification 2026-03-30)
- `cd.yml` — removed `staging-apply` and `production-apply` jobs; CD pipeline now targets `dev`
  only; staging/production promotion deferred to a future feature

### Removed

- `modules/example/` — CI/CD validation scaffold; superseded by `modules/azure-resource-group/`
- `environments/{env}/infra/` Terragrunt roots that sourced the example module
- `cd.yml` `workflow_dispatch` trigger block (staging/production manual promotion deferred)
